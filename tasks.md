# E-Commerce Application - Project Tasks

## Project Overview
Build a Next.js e-commerce application with multiple rendering strategies, API routes, and MongoDB + Prisma integration.

---

## Phase 1: Setup & Configuration
- [x] **Install Dependencies** - Install Mongoose and MongoDB driver

- [x] **Configure Environment Variables** - Set up .env.local with MongoDB URI
- [x] **Create Data Models** - Define Product schema with Mongoose
- [x] **Create Seed Script** - Initialize database with sample products

## Phase 2: Data & Backend API
- [x] **Seed Database** - Run `npx tsx seed.ts` to populate MongoDB with sample products
- [x] **GET /api/products** - Fetch all products endpoint
- [x] **GET /api/products/[slug]** - Fetch single product endpoint
- [x] **POST /api/products/create** - Add new product endpoint (with API key auth)
- [x] **PUT /api/products/[id]** - Update product endpoint (with API key auth)
- [x] **Add API Authentication** - Implement simple key-based auth for admin endpoints

## Phase 3: Frontend Pages
- [x] **Home Page (/)** - Client-side rendering with product listing
  - [x] Fetch products from API
  - [x] Display product cards
  - [x] Implement client-side search/filtering
  - [x] Add styling with Tailwind CSS
  - [x] Stock status indicators and badges
- [x] **Product Detail Page (/products/[slug])** - Client-side ISR simulation
  - [x] Dynamic routing with slug parameter
  - [x] Display product details
  - [x] Show inventory status
  - [x] Add to cart functionality with quantity selector
  - [x] Responsive layout with gradient backgrounds
- [x] **Inventory Dashboard (/dashboard)** - SSR (Server-Side Rendering)
  - [x] Fetch live data on every request (no caching)
  - [x] Display real-time statistics (total products, units, value)
  - [x] Show low stock warnings (â‰¤5 items)
  - [x] Display category breakdown with inventory values
  - [x] Show out of stock products list
  - [x] Display all products inventory table with status badges
- [x] **Admin Panel (/admin)** - Client-side fetching
  - [x] Create product form with full validation
  - [x] Update product form with ID lookup
  - [x] Edit existing products functionality
  - [x] Client-side validation (name, slug, price, inventory)
  - [x] Error handling and user feedback
  - [x] Success/error message display with auto-dismiss
  - [x] Tab navigation between create/update modes

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Bonus)
- [x] **Recommendations Page (/recommendations)** - Server & Client Components
  - [x] Server-side data fetching (SSR)
  - [x] Smart recommendations based on categories and value
  - [x] Hybrid server/client component architecture
  - [x] Client-side wishlist button with state management
  - [x] Popular product badges for highly stocked items

## Phase 5: Documentation & Testing
- [x] **Create README Report** - Document:
  - [x] Project structure
  - [x] Rendering strategies used
  - [x] Why each strategy was chosen
  - [x] How to run the project
  - [x] API documentation
  - [x] Testing instructions
  - [x] Future improvements
- [x] **Database Initialization** - Connect on server startup
  - [x] Database connected before first request
  - [x] Connection pooling implemented
  - [x] Available everywhere in the app
- [ ] **Test All Pages** - Verify all routes work correctly
- [ ] **Test All API Endpoints** - Verify endpoints with different scenarios
- [ ] **Test Admin Authentication** - Verify protected routes

## Phase 6: Deployment & Polish
- [ ] **Final Testing** - Test build and deployment
- [ ] **Performance Optimization** - Check Lighthouse scores
- [ ] **Final Touches** - Code cleanup and comments
